the longer you don’t ship, the longer you don’t ship

don’t try to raise too early - you are wasting runway on a gamble

dont try to justify your product/idea to people (especially if you’re “raising”). this can happen by speaking to your heroes too early.

connections wont help you get PMF

connections wont help you launch sooner

the more advice you get the longer it will take you to ship. choose 1 person to get advice from ONLY (probably your alliance mentor). Specialized questions maybe ok - (engineering/math/etc)

avoid advisors.
